    "N-grams are continuous sequences of words or symbols, or tokens in a document. In technical terms, they can be defined as the neighboring sequences of items in a document. They come into play when we deal with text data in NLP (Natural Language Processing) tasks. They have a wide range of applications, like language models, semantic features, spelling correction, machine translation, text mining, etc.\n",
    "n-grams are classified into the following types, depending on the value that ‘n’ takes.\n",

    "2\tBigram\n",

    "n\tn-gram\n",
    " n-grams are suitable for different types of applications. You should try different n-grams on your data in order to confidently conclude which one works the best among all for your text analysis. For instance, research has substantiated that trigrams and 4 grams work the best in the case of spam filtering."
